# Protein-Protein Intraction Network Analysis
Comparison of Tumor and Normal Cells Protein-Protein Interaction Network Parameters

## Dataset
The dataset originally is from the following paper, but we had a preprocessing and split it into the different CSV files based on the normal and cancer cells.

Rahman, KM Taufiqur, et al. "Changes in protein interaction networks between normal and cancer conditions: Total chaos or ordered disorder?", Network Biology, 2013

## Implementation
The analysis is implemented in R with iGraph lib.
